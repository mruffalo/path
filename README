PATH v0.32
Copyright (c) 2003-04 Francis Rogers

*** About ***

PATH is a programming language based on the Brainf*ck language. Unlike
conventional programming languages, PATH programs travel in four
directions.

For more information on the PATH language, visit: 
http://pathlang.sf.net/

*** Installation ***

NOTE: The PATH interpreter now requires Python to run. Make sure you've
got it installed.

To install the interpreter, run "python setup.py install". You should 
then be able to invoke the interpreter with "path".

After installation, you may want to read the PATH manual with "man path".

*** Plugins ***

The PATH language can be extended with interpreter plugins. You may put
the plugins in /usr/lib/path or ~/.path/ ; see the path man page for
details.

There is a plugin included in the PATH distribution: PyPATH. See
plugins/pypath.README for details.
