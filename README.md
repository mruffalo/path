About
=====

PATH is a programming language based on the Brainf*ck language. Unlike
conventional programming languages, PATH programs travel in four
directions, similarly to Befunge.

For more information on the PATH language, visit:
http://pathlang.sf.net/

Installation
============

PATH requires Python to install and run. Make sure you've got it installed
first. PATH runs on Python 3 and possibly also Python 2 (recent changes have
not been tested on Python 2).

To install the interpreter, run "python setup.py install". You should
then be able to invoke the interpreter with "path".

After installation, you may want to read the PATH manual with "man path".

Plugins
=======

The PATH language can be extended with interpreter plugins. You may put
the plugins in /usr/lib/path or ~/.path/ ; see the path man page for
details.

There are multiple plugins included with PATH. Check the various
plugins/*.README files for details on how to use them.
